# WebTemplate

A repo to hold my current standard workflow for building websites.

This uses the [howardroark/pollinate](https://github.com/howardroark/pollinate)
project to generate actual projects from the template.

## Usage

To use this, enter the command below after downloading pollinate

```
pollinate lannonbr/WebTemplate '{ "name": "ProjectName" }'
```
This will create a ProjectName directory and create a git repository inside it after the
files are created and parsed.
